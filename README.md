## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js installed
*   MongoDB Atlas Account
*   Cloudinary Account

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dheeraj-Kumar-089/WanderList
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory (or root if served from there) and install dependencies.

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```


Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:

```env
ATLASDB_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
SECRET=your_session_secret
CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUD_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUD_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
node app.js
# The server will typically run on http://localhost:8080
```

> **Note**: The backend `allowedOrigin` is currently configured for the production URL. For local development, please manually update the `allowedOrigin` variable in `backend/app.js` to match your local frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

### 3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit the application in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:5173`).
